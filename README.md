### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
