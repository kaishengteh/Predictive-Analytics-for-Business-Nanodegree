    "When zooming down to each movie title level, there seems to be 3 trend lines. The trend line with the steepest positive slope indicated successful movies which register much higher gross margin despite having low budget. They are among the outliers. Majority of the movies follow the other 2 trend lines with gradual slopes. As observed, increase in budget also increases the probability of raking in higher gross margin/loss. \n",
